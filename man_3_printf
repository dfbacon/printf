.SH NAME
_printf - replicate the printf function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include<stdarg.h>
.LP
.B int _printf(const char *
.I format
.B , ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.B _printf()
produces output according to a
.I format
as described below.  The function
.B _printf()
writes output to
.I stdout
, the standard output stream.
.LP
.SH Return Value
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed.
.LP
.SH Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not
.B %
), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the character 
.B %
, and ends with a
.I conversion specifier.
.LP
.SH The converstion specifier
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.LP
.B d, i
.LP
The
.I int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.  The default precision is 1. When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.LP
.B o, u, x, X
.LP
The
.I unsigned int
argument is converted to unsigned octal(
.B o
), unsigned decimal (
.B u
), or unsigned hexadecimal (
.B x
and
.B X
) notation. The letters
.B abcdef
are used for
.B x
conversions; the letters
.B ABCDEF
are used for
.B X
conversions. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. The default precision is 1. When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.LP
.B c
.LP
If no
.B l
modifier is present, the
.I int
argument is converted to an
.I unsigned char
, and the resulting character is written.
.LP
.B s
.LP
If no
.B l
modifier is present: The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'); if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written. If a precision is given, no null byte need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.
.LP
.B %
.LP
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
